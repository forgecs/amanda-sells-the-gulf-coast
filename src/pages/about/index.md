“I specialize in the condo market, second homes, and investment properties. I enjoy getting new people oriented to the area by showing them condos on the white sandy beaches or houses tucked away near the bays, as well as the best eats, drinks, and hidden local spots! My favorite part of this job is the excitement my clients express when they are matched with the perfect property and building lifelong relationships along the way!”

When Amanda is not selling houses, you can find her being a social butterfly! She’s the founder of a Mardi Gras Krewe and the Captain of an adult co-ed kickball team where both keep her heavily involved in the community through various volunteer events and social functions. She enjoys kayaking, walking the areas many nature trails with her dog, Wilson the Westie, and lounging at the beach with friends.
