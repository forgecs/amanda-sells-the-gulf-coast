      Amanda helped us sell my first home, and purchase two more properties. Her
      level of knowledge is exceptional, and along with that, she's a great
      listener and will let you vent like a friend. Actually, she's also now our
      friend. Amanda helped us sell for a great price, much higher than we were 
      expecting, and as a buyer got us many extra things thrown in.
