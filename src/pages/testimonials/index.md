      Amanda helped us sell my first home, and purchase two more properties. Her
      level of knowledge is exceptional, and along with that, she's a great
      listener and will let you vent like a friend. Actually, she's also now our
      friend. Amanda helped us sell for a great price, much higher than we were 
      expecting, and as a buyer got us many extra things thrown in.

      Amanda helped and patiently waited for me for over a year before I was
      ready to move and buy in Gulf Shores. She sent me listings and kept me
      updated. When I was ready to buy we met and spent the day looking at a
      wide variety of homes. I immediately liked her. She is very friendly, easy
      to talk  with, and professional in her real estate knowledge. She helped
      me find my current residence and I couldn't be happier. I would highly
      recommend her.
